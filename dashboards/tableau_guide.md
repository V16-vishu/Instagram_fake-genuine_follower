# Tableau / Power BI Dashboard Ideas

Recommended visuals:
1. **Target distribution** – bar chart of Fake vs Genuine counts.
2. **Follower vs Following** – scatter plot with color by Fake/Genuine; add reference lines.
3. **Follower/Following ratio** – box plot split by Fake/Genuine.
4. **Profile picture presence** – stacked bar by Fake/Genuine.
5. **Posts by label** – box plot of #posts split by Fake/Genuine.
6. **Top drivers** – import the feature importances CSV (export from notebook) and plot a ranked bar.

Suggested filters: private/public, profile_pic (yes/no), follower bins (e.g., 0–100, 100–1k, 1k–10k, 10k+).
